Unsupervised Learning Using K Means lesson

K-means Clustering Method:
 - If k is given, the K-means algorithm can be executed in the following steps:
 - Partition of objects into k non-empty subsets
 - Identifying the cluster centroids (mean point) of the current partition.
 - Assigning each point to a specific cluster
 - Compute the distances from each point and allot points to the cluster where the distance from the centroid is minimum.
 - After re-allotting the points, find the centroid of the new cluster formed

The data is given in dataset.csv file. The kmeans.py file performs clustering.
