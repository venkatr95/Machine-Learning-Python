# Regression

Regression models are used to predict a continuous value. Predicting prices of a house given the features of house like size, price and linear functions is one of the common examples of regression. It is a supervised technique.

Types of Regression are:

 - Simple Linear Regression
 - Polynomial Regression
 - Support Vector Regression
 - Decision Tree Regression
 - Random Forest Regression

#####Simple Linear Regression

This is one of the most common and interesting type of Regression technique. Here we predict a target variable Y based on the input variable X. A linear relationship should exist between target variable and prediction variable.

$Y = a + bX$

#####Polynomial Linear Regression

A regression equation is a polynomial regression equation if the power of independent variable is more than 1. The equation below represents a polynomial equation

$y=a+b*x^2$

In this regression technique, the best fit line is not a straight line. It is rather a curve that fits into the data points.
